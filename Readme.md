# This repository is created in order to update the process of my Master's Final Project from Electronics Engineering Master of Universitat de València.

Hi there! My name is Rubén and I'm an Electronics Engineer based in Valencia. Actually I'm coursing the Electronics Engineer Master in Universitat de València and the purpose of this repository is to have a place where I could upload my work and updating the project.

The project will be based on Computer Vision and Robotics applications using ROS to manage a diferential robot.
